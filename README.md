During our class, we discussed how to calculate the n-th Fibonacci Number, denoted as F(n), using top-down ( divide and conqure/ pure recursive) and bottom-up (dynamic-programming-like) methods. For this exercise, please complete the following tasks:
 
1. Write code to measure the execution time of F(1), F(2), ..., F(100) using both methods. Plot the results as a line chart. (if your program crashes during computation F(n+1) or takes too much time (>12hours) to compute one value, you can just stop and report the maximum value of n.)
2. Let's measure the degree of overlapping subproblem. Calculate the times are F(4) computed when we compute F(5),F(6),.....,F(50). Plot the results into line chart.
 
Please submit your code and the answers to these questions, along with a link to your code repository on GitHub.
